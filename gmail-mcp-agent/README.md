> An intelligent, autonomous email automation daemon acting upon incoming mail using intelligent filtering, auto-labeling, and zero-touch archiving, accompanied by a full React monitoring dashboard.

## 🌟 Why This Exists
Traditional spam filters and inbox rules are inherently rigid. By connecting the Gmail API directly to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and an advanced LLM, this agent evaluates the *semantic intent* of emails to accurately categorize, label, and clean inboxes far beyond simple keyword matching.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Semantic Auto-Labeling**: Routes emails to projects, actionable items, or newsletters based on deep contextual understanding.
- **Intelligent Spam/Cold-Outreach Filtering**: Learns your preference for cold emails and sweeps them to holding labels seamlessly.
- **React Monitoring Dashboard**: A beautiful frontend to audit how the agent classified recent emails and instantly override edge cases.
- **Zero-Touch Archiving**: Stateful rules that auto-archive completed threads or stale notifications.

## 🚀 Architecture Overview
The system relies on a decoupled architecture. 
1. **The Daemon**: A Python/FastAPI service heavily leveraging MCP to execute Gmail API operations based on Claude’s reasoning.
2. **The Dashboard**: A lightweight React frontend visualizer indicating latency, classification accuracy, and agentic confidence intervals.

## 🔧 Installation

**Backend Setup:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn agent_daemon:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

**Frontend Setup:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Detailed Google Cloud OAuth credential instructions are provided in `docs/SETUP.md`.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
This system incorporates robust evaluation criteria to ensure classification accuracy remains above 98% and inference latency is minimized securely.
